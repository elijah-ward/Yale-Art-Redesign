Throughout the term, lectures and presentations raise critical issues concerning the impact of digital applications and by-products on the medium of photography. Enrollment limited. Materials fee: $150."

Production focuses primarily on classical animation and digital stop-motion. Students utilize a variety of traditional and digital technologies to produce works that explore the fundamental principles of animation. In the first half of the course, students undertake weekly projects in dialogue with class lectures. The second half of the course is focused on individual project development, employing the core principles of animation in a work of the student’s design. Materials fee: $150."

We examine various techniques including pigment printouts on canvas, screen printing (both photo and non-photo based) on various materials, collaged prints (collograph, etching, and embossment) on canvas or over frames, toner transfers, laser cutting/etching as substrate and object, CNC milling, and the integration of 3-D printing and vacuum bag molding with painting. Demos, slide lectures, readings, and weekly group critiques in the printshop and studios complement the work."

                  "description": "This course will situate the body marked by gender as a political body by replacing gender binaries with a dialectical approach.  We will examine gender as a construction that, through the surplus caused by signification, exceeds biological sex.  Beginning with the contributions of feminist artists in the 60s and 70s and moving to the present, we will observe the ways in which the introduction of gender as a subject destabilizes sex, providing the groundwork for understanding gender within the symbolic and imaginary.  However, our analysis of gender will not confine itself to the representation of gender in works of art, or even to gender in the larger field of artistic discourse, but rather will concern itself with the role of gender in forming any political subject."

Throughout the year a full ensemble of the sculpture faculty and students meet weekly for critiques in which each student’s work is reviewed at least once per term. In addition, during the fall term only, a more intimate in-depth weekly critique takes place in two sections, each limited to eleven students and led by either Martin Kersels or Michael Queenland. There is no singular focus in this smaller critique, as the balance of pragmatic and conceptual considerations surrounding the work is examined and discussed in a fluid way depending on the work at hand and the intent of the artist.,"

                  "description": "Nervous when speaking in public? Then this course is for you— a public speaking course for artists and designers. Each student will perform a number of informal and formal speaking situations, including critique, job interview, etc. Students will play themselves as well as various alter egos in order to hone both the form (body language, eye contact, voice projection, verbal litter) and content (diction, clarity, substance) of what they say. The class focuses on the spoken rather than the written word, and takes to heart Maurice Merleau Ponty’s declaration that: “It is in the actual practice of speaking that I learn to understand.” (Phenomenology of Language) Guest speakers with various public speaking experiences and styles will help us master the craft. You will emerge more prepared for many future careers: artist, designer and teacher amongst them."
